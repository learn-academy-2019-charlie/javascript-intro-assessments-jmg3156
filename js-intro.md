#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  
    The combination of live demos and pair programming was helpful. Seeing how a concept generally worked was a great to introduce it.
    The pair programming was beneficial because sometimes my partner would have more knowledge and was able to further explain. Also, if my partner 
    had around the same amount of understanding as I did forced us to figure things out every step of the way.
